Function for a Factorial of n:

n! = (n)(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)


Factorial of n:

Step 1) print out statement asking for a number
Step 2) prompt user for number (num1) as an integer
Step 3) define a variable num2
Step 4) multiply num1 by (num1-1) and set to num2
Step 5) multiply num2 by (num1-2) and set to num2
Step 6) repeat this process until (num1-x) = 1
Step 7) print num2
