Cube Algoritm Project

1. Remove x rotations from beginning of list
    - remove head?  some algs don't have x rotations
    - remove all x, x', and x2?  can't do x first (x2, x', x)
    - 
2. Remove (12sq) from end of list
    - remove (9sq), (10sq).. individually?
    - find and remove everything in ()?
    - leave it?

3. Combine Moves
    - M M => M2, M' M' => M2
    - U U => U2, U' U' => U2
    - R' M => r', M R' => r'
    - R M' => r, M' R => r

4. Changing Orientation *** Hardest Challenge ***
    - changing R to l
    - changing every move after
    - R B2 U' B2 => l U2 F' U2
    - find and replace everything after the R => l change, nothing before
    - changing R' to l'
    - changing L to r
    - changing L' to r'

4. Making New Lists   
    - everything after the orientation change will be in a new list
    - everything in the new list will be changed orientation-wise again, and a new list made
    - all lists will be accessible in the same document, then sorted

5. Sorting Lists
    - all algs starting with M, M', M2
    - all algs ending with M, M', M2
    - M, M', and M2 algs can be ommitted from the end of algs

    - all algs starting with R, R', L, L', r, r', l, l'
    - all algs ending with R, R', L, L', r, r', l, l'
    - all algs starting with U, U', U2
    - all algs ending with U, U', U2
    - algs ending with U, U', U2 are advantageous for midge permutation
    - algs ending with U, U', U2 are advantageous for Waterman L7E cases
