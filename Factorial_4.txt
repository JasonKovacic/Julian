Factorial of 4:

4! = (4)(3)(2)(1)
4! = (12)(2)(1)
4! = (24)(1)
4! = 24

Factorial of n:

n! = (n)(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)


Factorial of n:

Print out statement asking for a number
take in number (n) as an integer

Assign variable to total value (total)


multiply n by a number one less than n (n-1)
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by a number two less than n (n-2)
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by a number three less than n (n-3)
set total to equal the answer
.
.
continue this process until the multiplying factor is 1
.
multiply result by 3
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by 2
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by 1
set total to equal the answer


Final result of everything multiplied together is the answer (total)

Output the answer (print total)





Alternative Factorial Method:


Print out statement asking for a number
take in number (n) as an integer

Assign variable to total value (total)


multiply n by 1
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by 2
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by 3
set total to equal the answer
.
.
continue this process until the multiplying factor is (n-1)
.
multiply result by (n-3)
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by (n-2)
set total to equal the answer
multiply result by (n-1)
set total to equal the answer

We can also use an index variable called i, to represent the number we are multiplying by
set i equal to 1
incrementally add 1 to i with each iteration
when i = (n-1), we stop multiplying

Final result of everything multiplied together is the answer (total)

Output the answer (print total)
