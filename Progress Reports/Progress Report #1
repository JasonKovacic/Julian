This is a daily progress report to be completed every evening between the hours of 5-7pm

1.

www.Bloc.io 
I would like to start going through the checkpoints of this online curriculum my parents enrolled me in a couple years ago
I don't have any more Mentoring sessions available, but the online curriculum is available to me for life, so I might as well take advantage of it.
Most of the checkpoints are done already, but I would probably do each and every one, hopefully very quickly.
I would like you to look at the curriculum as well, to see if it would be helpful.

2.
I also signed up for Pluralsight, since it's free through the end of April.
There are a few checkpoints on www.Bloc.io that require me to read

3.

I have re-read Learn you Haskell for a Great Good chapters 1-6.
I have edited my notes, located in the Haskell Folder through Chapter 6 with definitions


This is a loosely put together report.
Next one will be better
